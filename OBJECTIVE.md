## Friendly Advice

Feel free to use any technology, frameworks, libraries, and tools you wish to solve the
problem. Please include a README with clear instructions to view your solution,
otherwise a Casumo's umbrella will break in a storm.

- You're welcome to spend as long as you want, but please don't feel pressured.
- There's no deadline so there's no need to go crazy, rushing to get your
submission to us.
- Server side code is fun, but our primary interest is in the client side, so unless
you have a really cool idea, KISS.
Suggestion: The npm package http-server can serve static files easily.
- If this challenge doesn't seem fun to you, feel free to find another one. The
important thing to us is that we get a feel for where you are technically.
